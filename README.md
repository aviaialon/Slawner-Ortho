Things to remember:
	1. Update .htaccess to point to correct file path
	2. Update config/config.php to use proper configurations
	3. Will require apache to enable overrides and support mod_rewrite
	4. Will require read/write access on the following folders
		- / static / tmp
		- / static / images / uploads /
		- / core / database / cached_queries / 
		- / core / hybernate / object_cache /
